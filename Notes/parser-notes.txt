MiniJava Compiler Project - Parser & AST Notes
----------------------------------------------

1. Grammar Adjustments & LALR(1) Compatibility:
   To resolve IDENTIFIER ambiguities in an LALR(1) context, the grammar 
   enforces a strict "Declarations before Statements" order in method 
   bodies and the main class.

2. Conflict Handling:
   The grammar contains 1 expected Shift/Reduce conflict (Dangling Else). 
   This is handled using the '-expect 1' flag and resolved via the default 
   shift action, consistent with Java semantics.

3. AST & Line Numbers:
   Line numbers are captured by JFlex (%line) and passed through the 
   Symbol factory into the ASTNode base class. The -A visitor prints 
   these coordinates for every major node.

4. Automation & CLI:
   To simplify the build and test process, two wrapper scripts were 
   implemented:
   - ./build: Automates JFlex, CUP, and Javac steps.
   - ./mj: A custom CLI wrapper that handles classpaths and arguments.
